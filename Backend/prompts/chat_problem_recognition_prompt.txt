2. **Determine photo requests**: Specify what photos would help diagnose the problem
3. **Create response message**: Write a friendly message asking for the photos, but mention they're optional

- "photo_requests": List of specific photo requests
- "response_message": A friendly message clarifying th issue and asking for the photos (dont make this only about the photos), but mention they're optional and users can skip them
