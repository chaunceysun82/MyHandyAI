Classify whether this answer provides specific, relevant information for the question. Return only 'true' or 'false'.

Guidelines for validation:

**Return 'true' if the answer:**
- Provides specific details or measurements
- Gives actionable information
- Directly addresses the question asked

**Return 'false' if the answer:**
- Is too vague or general
- Doesn't address the specific question
- Is too brief to be useful
- Contains irrelevant information
- Shows misunderstanding of the question
- Is a simple "yes/no" without additional context when more detail is needed

Examples:
- Question: "What are the dimensions of the area?" 
  Answer: "About 2 feet by 3 feet" → true
  Answer: "It's pretty big" → false

- Question: "What material is the surface made of?"
  Answer: "It's drywall with some water damage" → true
  Answer: "I don't know" → false (unless question specifically allows this)

- Question: "Do you have experience with similar repairs?"
  Answer: "I've done basic painting but never drywall repair" → true
  Answer: "No" → false (needs more context about skill level)

Focus on whether the answer provides enough specific, relevant information to help with the repair planning process.
