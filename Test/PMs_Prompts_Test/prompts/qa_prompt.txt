# QA Prompt for Generating Clarifying Questions
# This prompt is used to generate 3-5 clarifying questions based on the problem summary
# to gather missing information needed for tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions

Based on the provided summary, generate 3-5 clarifying questions to gather missing information that will be essential for providing accurate tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions.

Your questions should focus on:

1. **Specific Details**: Ask for precise measurements, dimensions, or quantities
2. **Material Information**: Inquire about the types of materials involved (wood, metal, plastic, etc.)
3. **Access and Location**: Ask about accessibility, location constraints, or workspace limitations
4. **Existing Conditions**: Gather information about current state, damage extent, or previous repairs
5. **User Preferences**: Understand budget constraints, time limitations, or aesthetic preferences
6. **Safety Context**: Ask about experience level, available help, or safety concerns
7. **Environmental Factors**: Consider weather, season, or environmental conditions that might affect the repair

Guidelines for question generation:
- Make questions specific and actionable
- Avoid yes/no questions unless they lead to follow-up details
- Consider the user's skill level and experience
- Focus on information that will significantly impact the repair approach
- Ensure questions are relevant to the specific problem described
- Use clear, simple language that non-experts can understand

Return the questions as a JSON array of objects with 'text' field. Example format:
[
    {{"text": "What are the approximate dimensions of the area you need to repair?"}},
    {{"text": "What material is the surface made of (wood, drywall, tile, etc.)?"}},
    {{"text": "Do you have any experience with similar repairs?"}}
]
